## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


### Links

- Live Site URL: [](https://results-summary-by-rj.netlify.app/)




## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow


### Continued development

In short, at this moment I am sure that I need to focus my efforts on improving my CSS skills a lot, since although this exercise looks quite simple, it was very complex for me to perform due to my inexperience, the main aspect that I want to improve is the time it takes me to finish a project like this one, since in this case, it took me more than 3 hours and I feel that my code could be much more efficient, but I do not know where to start or what specific topics I should learn to improve.
